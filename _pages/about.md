I'm an undergraduate student at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) studying mathematics and computer science, but I'm usually considering problems in statistics. My current interests lie in kernel methods, hypothesis testing and causal inference. Due to my past-life in pure math, I'm also strongly drawn towards mathematically rich problems in statistics or machine learning. I'm fortunate to be studying these topics under the supervision of [Dr. Danica Sutherland's](https://djsutherland.ml/) as an undergrad research assistant.
